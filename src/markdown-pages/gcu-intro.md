<h3> MESSAGE BY THE VICE CHANCELLOR </h3>

 <div>

Since its inception in 1864, the GC University Lahore has been one of the leading higher education institutions in Asia. We are honoured that the spiritual father of our nation, Allama Mohammad Iqbal, is an alumnus of GCU, and proud that two Nobel laureates, Har Gobind Khorana and Abdus Salam, are also amongst our past colleagues. Our Ravians, young and old, have been contributing strongly to the shaping and development of Pakistan.

For the last 156 years, we have pursued, nurtured and celebrated excellence in a wide variety of disciplines. It is no coincidence that our motto “Courage to Know” is a call to students, faculty and staff members alike to realize their fullest potential and the University’s mission.

> I have identified the following goals for my tenure as the Vice Chancellor of this most prestigious institution:

> Education: Improving the quality of teaching as part of our drive towards raising the quality of higher education in Pakistan and contribute towards the country-wide social investment currently underway. Aligned with this goal, we will also increase the reach of higher education to under-privileged segments of our youth and improve the employability of our graduates.

> Research: Strengthening our research and innovation base and linkages to industries and policy-making communities and in the process becoming a leading institution of applied research. As an example, we aspire to establish new Centres of Excellence linked with public policy and governance, public health and population ageing.
